# mall_customer_analysis_Rprogramming
The aim of this project is to analyze the spending behavior of customer groups using various techniques.

## Hypothesis
### Hypothesis 1 : Female customers have a higher spending score than male customers.

- Aim 1: Analyze the average spending score by creating a box plot for both genders by grouping the data by gender
- Aim 2: Conduct a statistical test (Two Sample T-test) to determine if the difference in spending scores between the genders is statistically significant.

### Hypothesis 2: There is a positive relationship between annual income and spending score.

- Aim 1: Generate a scatter plot to visually examine the relationship between annual income and spending score.
- Aim 2: Linear Regression analysis to examine the relationship between annual income and spending score.
- Aim 3: K-means clustering to investigate the distribution of the relationship between annual income and spending score

### Hypothesis 3: There is a positive relationship between middle-aged customers and spending score.

- Aim 1: Categorized the age data into relevant groups (Teenager,Young A-B,Middle Age A-B,Elder A-B,Above 70) then visualise as boxplot and finding the spending means of each class to analyzed the average spending 		scores.
- Aim 2: To examine the age group with the highest spending score, linear regression and correlation.



## Conclusion
### Hypothesis 1 
- There is no significant difference between the spending scores of males and females according to boxplot and two sample t-test.
### Hypothesis 2
- There is no positive relationship between annual income and spending score. K-means clustering result shows that different clusters have different annual income and spending scores.
### Hypothesis 3
- It cannot be said that the highest spending score is directly had by middle-aged people. There is a negative relationship between age and spending score, which is determined by correlation matrix and linear regression. It can be said that people aged 20-40 have the highest spending score
